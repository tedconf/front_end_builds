# FrontEndBuilds

**Warning: Beta software!**

Front-End Builds lets you easily serve remotely-hosted static (JS) applications from your Rails apps.

Benefits:
  - JS app can be deployed without redeploying your Rails app
  - Easily smoke test SHAs, branches and releases in your production environment with query params:
    http://your-app.com/my-ember-app?branch=new-feature

Features:
  - Admin interface lets you easily view, rollback and activate different app versions

The motivation for this gem came from [Luke Melia's RailsConf2014 talk](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3324-railsconf-lightning-fast-deployment-of-your-rails-backed-javascript-app).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'front_end_builds'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Front-End Builds brings some migrations along with it. To run, execute

```
rake front_end_builds:install:migrations
```

## Usage

First, mount the admin interface in `routes.rb`:

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do

  mount FrontEndBuilds::Engine, at: '/frontends'

end
```

You should mount this under an authenticated route using your application's
auth strategy, as anyone with access to the admin will be able to affect the
production builds of your front end apps.a

If you don't want to set up an HTML auth strategy, you can do something like this:

```rb
# routes.rb
protected_app = Rack::Auth::Basic.new(FrontEndBuilds::Engine) do |username, password|
  username == 'admin' && password == (Rails.env.production? ? ENV['FEB_ADMIN_PASSWORD'] : '')
end
mount protected_app, at: '/frontends'
```

This will use basic HTTP auth to secure access to your admin ui. Just set the ENV variable, and use it to gain access.

Now, to create a new app, first add a `front_end` route pointing to your app in `routes.rb`:

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do

  front_end 'app-name', '/app-route'

end
```

Visit the admin (at whatever URL you mounted the engine above), create a
new app named `app-name`, and you'll receive  instructions on how to
start pushing builds.

#### Option to host two client(web/mobile) on same path:

 Default client is 'web',
 
 To serve mobile client app on same domain name, create app with same name as web client and choose client as mobile. 
 
 
Note:
If you're using this engine to serve an ember app at the Root, be sure
to put all other Rails routes above the `front_end` route - as this take priority
over all routes below it!

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # All other Rails routes here

  front_end 'app-name', '/'
end
```


## Development

**Admin**

The Admin interface is an Ember CLI app within feb. A distribution is kept
within the gem, and must be updated whenever admin code is updated.

After changing the admin app, run

```
rake admin:build
```

to store a fresh distribution.

**Running tests**

```
# Rails tests
rspec

# Admin tests, from /admin dir
ember test
```

## TODO

* Create docs site
* Auto live setting
* make posts idempotent (i think they are), but dont insert a new row if
  it already exists.
