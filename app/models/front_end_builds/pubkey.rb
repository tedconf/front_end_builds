      # Bug in ruby's OpenSSL implementation.
      # SSL connection with PostgreSQL can fail, after a call to
      # OpenSSL::X509::Certificate#verify with result 'false'. Root cause is
      # the thread local error queue of OpenSSL, that is used to transmit
      # textual error messages to the application after a failed crypto
      # operation. A failure in Certificate#verify leaves some messages on the
      # error queue, which can lead to errors in a SSL communication of other
      # parts of the application. The only solution at the moment is running:
      # OpenSSL.errors.clear after certificate verifying. This clears OpenSSL
      # errors array and keeps database connection alive.
      # From https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/7215
      OpenSSL.errors.clear
